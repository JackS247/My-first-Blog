      <p class="one">
         Being a native English speaker, I've never had to worry about learning a new language. Whether it's abroad on holiday or travelling the world I have always got by speaking English. Of course, some
        people do not understand everything you say, but in terms of speaking
        English, the majority of the world understands it, hence until the age of
        twenty five I never thought of venturing outside of it. Call it ignorance, but it is the advantage and plight of an English native, unless you're passionate about another culture, why learn another language?

      <p class="two">That all changed when I met my German friend Melissa at University. In the beginning, we communicated in English, in fact apart from the odd phrase we rarely spoke German, but what happened after was an introduction to a new language that left me curious to learn more. Melissa spoke very good English, and as with most Germans I've met, they made it look effortless( I wish I could say the same)! Being born in England, languages are taught, but it's up to you whether you want to pursue one or not, for me, French and Spanish just seemed like too much effort for my adolescent self. I wouldn't say my progress in speaking German is anything spectacular, but the progress comes in waves, and alcohol helps! </p>

<p>As mentioned, my first introduction to German was through a chance meeting with one, she opened my eyes up to a new culture and eventually a new life. I've now lived in Berlin,Hamburg and Munich, and while my German is far from perfect, I can communicate in it, some people might call it "Gastro Deutsch", or in English, "Cafe German".The thing about speaking a new language is you constantly have to think about what you're going to say, and sometimes in fact you say less because you cannot find the words. Learning a new language has humbled me in that respect, but if you can harness your words and say more without saying so much, this is more powerful. </p>

<p class="journey"> There are times when speaking German that it becomes very challenging, for example not being able to fully express myself, I guess you could say is a limitation of sorts. But that's not the language's fault, but rather a lack of knowledge on my part. Being able to switch to English where and when I please is always a safety net, but this hinders progress too. However there are times when I am impressed with my level of German, for instance communicating what I want and having success in that, my younger self would be like wow, did you just say that? And in that lies the motivation to continue, those brief moments where you check yourself and realise how far you have come. </p>

    <p> Starting the next chapter in my life, I've learnt that if you do a little bit of something every day, there is progress to be had. For example, going to the Gym, if it's you're first time going and you're expecting results straight away you will be disappointed, in fact, you may injure yourself. Training a little bit every day, however, can pay dividends. Writing this blog that I designed myself, a week ago I would have had no idea how to even register "Hello World" on the screen, now I'm grasping the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. This is the logic I plan to apply not only to German but to my journey in software development and other aspects of my life. </p>
